                       <h3>RAIN</h3>
              <p>Rain is liquid water in the form of droplets that have condensed from atmospheric water vapor and then become heavy enough to fall    under gravity.</p>
              <p>Rain is a major component of the water cycle and is responsible fo depositing most of the fresh water on the Earth.</p>           <p>Rain and snow are key elements in the Earth's water cycle, which is vital to all life on Earth. Rainfall is the main way that the    water in the skies comes down to Earth, where it fills our lakes and rivers, recharges the underground aquifers, and provides        drnks to plants and animals.</p>
              <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND IT?</p></strong>
             <p>Rain is the droplets of water that fall from clouds. Heat from the Sun turns moisture (Water) from plants and leaves, as well as oceans, lakes, and rivers.</p>
